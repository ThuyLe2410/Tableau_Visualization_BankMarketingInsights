### Visualization of Bank Marketing Campaign Data

This project involves creating data visualizations to answer key business questions and derive insights for future marketing campaigns. The visualizations include:

- **Which segment of the population should we target?**
Focus on individuals aged 26-55, particularly those with tertiary education and stable marital status (married). This segment shows the highest subscription rates and financial stability.

- **What distribution channel should we use?**
Prioritize cellular contacts, as they have the highest engagement rates. Consider supplementary methods like email or social media to reinforce the campaign message.

- **What is the optimal duration for contact?**
Aim for longer contact durations to increase the likelihood of subscription. Ensure representatives are well-trained to maintain engaging and informative conversations.  A policy should be implemented that states that no more than 3 calls should be applied to the same potential client in order to save time and effort in getting new potential clients.

- **Which months and days are most effective for campaigns?**
Plan major campaigns around March and November for higher subscription rates. Analyze daily trends to identify and leverage high-impact days for contact.

- **How does client education and loan status affect campaign success?**
Target clients with higher education levels (tertiary) and those without existing loans, as they show higher engagement and subscription rates.
